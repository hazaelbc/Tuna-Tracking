# Tuna-Tracking
Computer Vision System for Tuna Counting Developed a ML system using YOLO + DeepSORT to automate tuna counting in farms. I curated a custom dataset to prioritize anatomical morphology over color, overcoming underwater lighting challenges and reducing overfitting. Achieved high tracking persistence and reliable accuracy in dynamic environments.
